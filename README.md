A dynamic CV Application generator built with React that allows users to create a resume through their inputs and save the resume to PDF.

The purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate understanding of functional React components, through the use of hooks to handle state, props, event listeners, dynamic styling, unified state, conditional rendering, and forms/inputs.
